       <p>Tracer- Her real name is Lena Oxton, and she was a former British pilot who was recruited by Overwatch's experimental flight program. However, during a flight test, she became trapped in a temporal anomaly that caused her to disappear from time and space.
 
 
         After months of being lost in time, Tracer finally reappeared, but with her molecules destabilized, making her unable to maintain a solid form in the present for more than a few seconds. She was then fitted with a chronal accelerator that allowed her to control her own time, giving her the ability to "blink" short distances and reverse time to heal herself or undo mistakes.
        
         In the game, Tracer is a highly mobile hero, who is able to dart in and out of combat with her blinks and rewinds. She is a popular choice among players who enjoy a fast-paced, hit-and-run playstyle, and is known for her upbeat personality and British accent.</p>
